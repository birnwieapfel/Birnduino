An Arduino clone with an RS232 serial interface.

In 2013, I bought a board call "Freeduino Serial v2.0", which is an Arduino clone having an RS232 serial interface using a MAX232. But it seems that it is not available anymore now and I could not find the original files of the "v2.0". So I decided to create my own based on some information about the Freeduino I found in the internet and having a look at my "Freeduino Serial v2.0" board...

This repository contains KiCad 6.0 project files.
