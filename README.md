An Arduino clone with an RS232 serial interface.

Long time ago, I bought a board call "Freeduino serial v2.0", which is an Arduino clone having an RS232 serial interface. But it seems that it is not available anymore now and I could find the original files of the "v2.0". So I decided to create my own based on some information about the Freeduino I found in the internet and having a look at my "Freeduino Serial v2.0" board...

This repository contains KiCad 6.0 project files.

"Freeduino Serial" is based on the Arduino Diecimila reference design (www.arduino.cc/main/ArduinoBoardDiecimila).


The work uses the **Arduino KiCad Library**, available here: https://github.com/Alarm-Siren/arduino-kicad-library.
I added an additional board "Arduino_Serial_Shield" to this library.
